        I am developing projects with React. I'm trying to do responsive work. I
        share my projects on my github. I'm currently in the process of learning
        Django and Docker. Afterwards, I planned to learn Next.js, Typescript
        and Node.js. I'm always open to learning new technologies and I love it.
